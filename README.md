So, here I'll be talking about one of my college projects "GymPro". It is an android app which was targeted to users who dont have gym equipment or don't have time to go to the gyms and thus want to take care of their health in the comfort of their home. 
The main task of this app was to give recommendations based on the age and gender of the user. As the app has to be designed in such a way that even old age people can use them with ease. Hence, the UI was kept quite simple with just selecting target muscle, exercises, asanas or yogas. A timer was kept to start the execise at their choice. Instructions on how to perform the exercises were also mentioned below.

There are many future features planned for the app such as custom budget-friendly diet plans, customizable diet plans or recommendations from experts, virtual gym training by experts, locations of gyms nearby,etc. will also be implemented in the future.

I'm extremely proud of being part of such project which targets helping people in being fit and achieving their dream of living a healthy life.
